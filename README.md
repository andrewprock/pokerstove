PokerStove
==========

The core libraries of pokerstove are being open sourced.  The project
is currently in the process of reviewing the code and evaluating
licences.  Once a license has been settled on, and the code sanitized
the first commits can start.  Until then, please find the old
installer in the win32 directory.
