 * preflop hold'em hand types, but with arbitrarily assigned suits.  For
 * example AQs is represented by AcQc
 *
 * Card::Rank: The set of cards with no suit information.  For example,
 * with an argument of 2, a set of size 91 will be generated, with each
 * element representing a CardSet with two cards, set to the canonical rank
 * representation.
